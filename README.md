# Data Structures and Algorithms Newsletter

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the weekly newsletter of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Maastricht University. This newsletter aims to provide students with engaging and insightful content about various algorithms and data structures, presented in a fun and accessible way.

## About the Newsletter

Each week, we explore a different algorithm or data structure, breaking down its complexity and showcasing its real-world applications. The newsletter includes code examples, practical challenges, and additional resources to help students deepen their understanding of the topic.
